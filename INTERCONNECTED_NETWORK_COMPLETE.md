### **📊 Technical Implementation**

#### **Line Connection Algorithm**
```javascript
// Authentic Mumbai railway connections
lineConnections = {
    'Western': [station-to-station pairs],
    'Central Main': [station-to-station pairs], 
    'Trans-Harbour': [station-to-station pairs + branches]
}

// Junction mapping with real Mumbai coordinates
junctions = [
    {Dadar: Western↔Central},
    {Kurla: Central↔Harbour},
    {Thane: Central↔Trans-Harbour}
]
```
