## 🚂 Simulation System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Network Topology Engine
```javascript
// Authentic Mumbai station coordinates
const stations = [
    { name: "Churchgate", lat: 18.9354, lon: 72.8274, line: "Western" },
    { name: "Dadar", lat: 19.0176, lon: 72.8448, line: "Junction" },
    // ... 28 more stations
];

// Real interconnections
const junctions = [
    { primary: "Dadar", connects: ["Western", "Central Main"] },
    { primary: "Kurla", connects: ["Central Main", "Trans-Harbour"] }
];
```

#### 2. Train Movement System
```javascript
// Path-following movement with realistic physics
function updateTrainPathMovement(train) {
    // Calculate realistic speed based on conditions
    let targetSpeed = getRealisticTrainSpeed(train);
    
    // Apply acceleration/deceleration
    const acceleration = Math.sign(speedDiff) * Math.min(Math.abs(speedDiff), 5);
    train.currentSpeed += acceleration * deltaTime;
    
    // Update position along railway path
    const progressIncrement = (speedInKmPerSecond * deltaTime) / segmentDistance;
    train.pathProgress += progressIncrement;
}
```

#### 3. Factor System
```javascript
// 11 Comprehensive operational factors
const factors = {
    // Basic factors
    rushHourMultiplier: 1.0,          // Peak hour congestion
    weatherDelayMultiplier: 1.0,      // Monsoon/weather impact
    infrastructureDelay: 1.0,         // Track/signal issues
    
    // Advanced factors
    junctionCongestionMultiplier: 1.0, // Bottleneck management
    equipmentReliabilityFactor: 1.0,   // Train mechanical issues
    festivalCrowdSurge: 1.0,          // Cultural event impacts
    platformCapacityStrain: 1.0,      // Physical limitations
    staffEfficiencyFactor: 1.0,       // Human factors
    externalInfrastructureDelay: 1.0   // External disruptions
};
```

## 🧠 AI System Implementation

### 1. Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent

#### Architecture
```javascript
class DeepReinforcementLearningAgent {
    constructor() {
        this.qTable = new Map();           // State-action values
        this.learningRate = 0.1;           // Learning speed
        this.discountFactor = 0.95;        // Future reward importance
        this.explorationRate = 0.1;        // Exploration vs exploitation
    }
    
    // Q-learning update formula
    updateQValue(state, action, reward, nextState) {
        const currentQ = this.qTable.get(stateKey)[action] || 0;
        const maxNextQ = Math.max(...Object.values(nextQValues), 0);
        const newQ = currentQ + this.learningRate * 
                    (reward + this.discountFactor * maxNextQ - currentQ);
    }
}
```

#### How It Works
1. **State Recognition**: Analyzes current system conditions (delays, congestion, weather)
2. **Action Selection**: Chooses optimal intervention (frequency increase, rerouting, etc.)
3. **Reward Calculation**: Measures improvement in efficiency and delay reduction
4. **Learning**: Updates knowledge for future similar situations

### 2. Graph Neural Network Optimizer

#### Network Representation
```javascript
class GraphNeuralNetworkOptimizer {
    buildMumbaiGraph() {
        return {
            nodes: ['Churchgate', 'Dadar', 'Bandra', 'Andheri', 'CST', ...],
            edges: [
                ['Churchgate', 'Marine Lines'],
                ['Dadar', 'Bandra'],
                // Authentic Mumbai connections
            ],
            junctions: ['Dadar', 'Kurla', 'Thane']
        };
    }
}
```

#### Optimization Process
1. **Topology Analysis**: Maps entire network as interconnected graph
2. **Bottleneck Detection**: Identifies congestion points using node features
3. **Flow Optimization**: Redistributes train loads across alternate paths
4. **Junction Management**: Prioritizes train movements at critical intersections

### 3. Predictive Analytics Engine

#### Forecasting Algorithm
```javascript
class PredictiveAnalyticsEngine {
    predictDelays() {
        const predictions = [];
        const recentTrend = this.analyzeRecentTrend();
        
        Object.values(detailedTrains).forEach(train => {
            const riskScore = this.calculateDelayRisk(train, recentTrend);
            if (riskScore > 0.7) {
                predictions.push({
                    trainId: train.id,
                    predictedDelay: train.delay + riskScore * 3,
                    confidence: riskScore,
                    recommendedAction: this.getDelayMitigation(train)
                });
            }
        });
        
        return predictions;
    }
}
```

#### Prediction Capabilities
- **5-minute ahead delay forecasting**
- **Weather impact prediction**
- **Passenger surge detection**
- **Equipment failure early warning**

### 4. Federated Multi-Agent System

#### Agent Coordination
```javascript
class FederatedMultiAgentSystem {
    constructor() {
        this.agents = {
            westernLine: new LineAgent('Western'),
            centralLine: new LineAgent('Central Main'),
            transHarbour: new LineAgent('Trans-Harbour')
        };
    }
    
    optimizeSystem() {
        // Each line agent optimizes locally
        const localOptimizations = {};
        for (const [lineName, agent] of Object.entries(this.agents)) {
            localOptimizations[lineName] = agent.optimize();
        }
        
        // Global coordination resolves conflicts
        return this.coordinationProtocol.coordinate(localOptimizations);
    }
}
```
