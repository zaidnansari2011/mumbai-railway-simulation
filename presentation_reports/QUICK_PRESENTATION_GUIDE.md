## 🛡️ Handling Questions

### "How accurate is your simulation?"
**Answer:** "We used authentic Mumbai railway data - real EMU specifications, actual station coordinates, and genuine operational patterns researched from Indian Railways sources."

### "Can this really scale to the full network?"
**Answer:** "Absolutely. Our modular architecture currently handles 40 trains across 30 stations. The same principles scale to 400+ stations and 3000+ daily trains."

### "What about integration with existing systems?"
**Answer:** "We built this with integration in mind - standard web technologies, API-ready architecture, and transparent decision-making that works with human operators."

### "How do you ensure AI decisions are safe?"
**Answer:** "Every AI decision is logged with specific context. Human operators maintain oversight, and the system provides recommendations rather than autonomous control."
