## PROJECT SUMMARY

**Mumbai Railway Simulation - COMPLETED**

This project is a comprehensive simulation of Mumbai's Suburban Railway network designed for incremental factor testing. The simulation allows users to:

1. **Test Individual Factors**: Enable/disable specific factors (rush hour, weather, maintenance, etc.) to understand their impact
2. **Compare Scenarios**: Run multiple scenarios with different factor combinations
3. **Analyze Performance**: Track comprehensive metrics including delays, efficiency, and passenger satisfaction
4. **Learn Incrementally**: Start simple and add complexity gradually

**Key Features:**
- Accurate Mumbai railway network topology (Western, Central Main, Central Harbour, Trans-Harbour lines)
- Modular factor system (6 categories: Infrastructure, Passenger Demand, Weather, Operational, External Events, Technical)
- Real-time simulation engine with configurable time steps
- Comprehensive metrics and reporting
- CLI interface with multiple testing modes
- Example scenarios and tutorials
- Complete test suite

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Quick test
python mumbai_railway_sim.py --mode quick --duration 1

# Test rush hour impact
python mumbai_railway_sim.py --mode factor-test --factors "rush_hour_only_Rush Hour Demand" --duration 2

# Compare scenarios
python mumbai_railway_sim.py --mode compare --duration 1

# Run examples
python examples/examples.py 1
```

**Architecture:**
- Modular design with separate packages for network, simulation, and factors
- YAML-based configuration system
- Event-driven simulation with callbacks
- Extensible factor system for adding new disruption types
- Comprehensive metrics collection and analysis

The project is ready for use and further extension. All requirements from the copilot-instructions.md have been successfully implemented.
